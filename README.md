# Advanced-ODU-Mapping-in-Optical-Networks-Communication-Network-Design-(with Nokia)

This repository contains the course project for **Communication Network Design** at Politecnico di Milano, developed in collaboration with **Nokia**.  
The project focuses on optimizing the assignment of Optical Data Units (ODUs) to multi-carrier transponder framers under capacity and operational constraints.

## ðŸ“¡ Project Overview
Modern optical networks use **multi-carrier transponders** to efficiently map multiple service types. This project compares multiple optimization methods to assign ODUs to framers while:
- Balancing traffic across framers
- Maximizing capacity utilization
- Preventing overload and minimizing unassigned traffic

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Constraints
- **Framer Capacity:** 500 Gbit/s per framer
- **Framer ODU Limit:** 200 ODUs per framer
- **ODU Types:**  
  - ODU0 â†’ 1.25 Gbit/s  
  - ODU2 â†’ 10 Gbit/s  
  - ODU4 â†’ 100 Gbit/s  
  - ODUC4 â†’ 400 Gbit/s  
- **Traffic Source:** Port 2 (up to 1000 Gbit/s)

## âš™ Optimization Methods Implemented
1. **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** â€“ optimal for small-scale problems  
2. **Brute Force** â€“ exhaustive search for benchmarking  
3. **Greedy Algorithm** â€“ fast but suboptimal  
4. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** â€“ near-optimal with evolutionary strategies  
5. **Simulated Annealing (SA)** â€“ probabilistic refinement  
6. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** â€“ swarm intelligence-based search  
7. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** â€“ pheromone-based iterative improvement

## ðŸ“Š Simulation Setup
- 30 random traffic scenarios generated  
- Each method evaluated for:
  - Load distribution
  - Execution time
  - Unassigned traffic

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
- ILP and Brute Force achieve optimal solutions but have scalability limits
- Metaheuristics (GA, SA, PSO, ACO) achieve near-optimal results with better scalability
- Greedy method is fastest but results in higher unassigned traffic
